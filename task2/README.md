This second task was a multi-class classification task with a highly imbalanced dataset.  

Learning from our mistakes in task 1 we validated our models properly with 5-fold cross validation and grid search. The final model was a support vector machine where the class imbalance problem was handled by balancing the class weights according to frequency in the input data. This model took us to position 20 out of roughly 200 teams.
