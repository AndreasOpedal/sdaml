This second task was a 3-class disease classification task with a highly imbalanced dataset derived from medical images.  

Learning from our mistakes in task 1 we validated our models properly with 5-fold cross validation and grid search. The final model was a support vector machine where the class imbalance problem was handled by balancing the class weights according to frequency in the input data. This model took us to position 20 out of roughly 200 teams of ETH master students.
