The first task concerned predicting age from brain image data. The data given were around 200 features derived from MRI images. The data had however been modified in three ways: added irrelevant features, added outliers and perturbations in the form of missing values.  

In terms of performance and score this task was a failure for our team, as our model overfitted on the public test data. We did however learn a lot from this first task when it comes to combatting data leakage and overfitting, insights that we then used in the following tasks which resulted in significantly better positions on the leaderboard.
