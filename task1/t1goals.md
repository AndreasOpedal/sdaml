Task 1 Goals
=========

1. Preprocessing - preprocessing.py

 1.1 Remove missing values
 1.2 Select top X features (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html)
 1.3 Normalize features
 1.4 Visualize (normalized) top X features (scatter plot different columns, PCA, t-SNE)
 1.5 Do linear regression fit (with and without regularization) and visualize (answers whether we need a nonlinear model)
 1.6 Submit initial model and see how it performs

2. Model - model.py
 2.1 Model selection
     - Change features used
     - Square some features etc
     - Try some built in scipy models that are fast (random forests, polynomial reg)
 2.2 Cross-validation (run our models and test)
