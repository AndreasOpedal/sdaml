The third task was a multi-class classification task of time series data, in the form of ECG signals.

Preprocessing was paramount in this task. By studying the properties of ECG signals we could decide what would be relevant features to extract from the raw time series data. Among those were summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation etc of the R peaks of the signals, time difference between R peaks and heart rate templates. This was done with the help of the biosppy package. Once feature extraction was complete, we used a grid search pipeline to cross validate different models. The final model was a Gradient Boosting Classifier with a median imputing strategy for missing values, which took us to a position of around 30-50 out of around 200 ETH students (leaderboard is no longer available at the time of writing).
